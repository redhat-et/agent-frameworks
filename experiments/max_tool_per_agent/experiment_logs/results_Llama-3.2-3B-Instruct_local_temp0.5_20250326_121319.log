session id is eefce422-f239-42ab-93f2-fc5d100537d7
Inference: It seems that the `insurance_scorer` function has returned a result of 8. This is likely a subjective scoring system used to evaluate the risk level or likelihood of an insurance claim. The actual meaning of this score would depend on the specific criteria used by the function.

If you'd like to know more about what factors influenced the score, I can try to reverse engineer it from the provided output. However, since the `insurance_scorer` function is not publicly documented, I couldn't determine the exact reasoning behind the score.
